			<p> Tesla is responsible for the fundamental principles and deriving the electrical infrastructure used throughout the world today for power distribution: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current"> Alternating Current (AC)</a>. He built
				the world's first induction motor and is considered the father of modern technology, having had a hand in the development of fluorescent lighting, x-ray machines, radio, television and wireless communication technology.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="center-block well" style="margin:10px">
			<p>During his life, Nikola obtained around 100 patents for his over 700 different inventions. However, despite being a prolific inventor, some would argue that his lack of business acumen is to blame for his hardship later in life.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="center-block well" style="margin:10px">
			<p>Tesla was known to have an eidetic memory, through which he was able to recall entire books in meticulous detail. Combined with his high level of spatial reasoning, it is claimed that he was able to assemble entire designs in his mind prior to building
				or noting them down on paper.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="center-block well" style="margin:10px">
			<p>Tesla was a polite gentleman even though many regarded him as eccentric and asocial. He reported being able to feel the magnetic field surrounding other persons and despised any physical contact with others as a result, often refusing to shake hands
				in social situations. He was also known to be extremely fond of pigeons, to the point of caring for them as pets in his places of residence. Clinically, he was an insomniac, claiming to only sleep around 2 hours at a time.</p>

				<li><span class="timeline-number">1880</span> - Tesla travels to Prague with the financial help of his two uncles. He is unable to enroll at the Karl-Ferdinand University but chooses to attend it as an auditing student.
					<li><span class="timeline-number">1881</span> - Nikola begins working at the Telephone Exchange in Budapest. Within a few months, the recognition of his aptitude gets him promoted to the position of Chief Electrician.</li>
					<li><span class="timeline-number">1882</span> - First envisions the AC motor during an epiphany in Budapest. He also moved to Paris and took up a position at the Continental Edison Company.</li>
					<li><span class="timeline-number">1883</span> - Demonstrates the AC motor for the first time before potential investors in Strasbourg, but his invention is not yet recognised as a significant advancement with tremendous potential.</li>
					<li><span class="timeline-number">1884</span> - Travels to the USA, but nearly gets thrown overboard during a mutiny on the ship. His possessions are also stolen along the way. Nikola begins working with Thomas Edison, who instead advocated the DC system of electricity distribution. This
						began a lifelong rivalry concerning the ideal method for distributing electricity. During his time with Edison, he designed over 20 machines that superseeded Edison's designs. </li>
					<li><span class="timeline-number">1885</span> - Improves the performance of the DC network at Edison's request, exceeding expections. The sum of $50,000 he was promised for the work was never paid to him. Following this incident, relations broke down between the two and Tesla quit working
						for Edison.</li>
					<li><span class="timeline-number">1887</span> - The Tesla Electric Company is established in New York City, with the help of funding from investors, in return for evenly splitting ownership of his patents.</li>
					<li><span class="timeline-number">1888</span> - Tesla gives his famous discourse on the new AC motor before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE). He also sells some patents from the AC motor to George Westinghouse in Pittsburg, and stays at the Westinghouse headquarters
						to continue developing his motor.</li>
					<li><span class="timeline-number">1889</span> - Begins working on high-frequency electronics and wireless communications in a new laboratory located in New York City.
